next js features repetition
---------------------------

let: variable values

const: constant values

arrow function: keeps always the this scope

export & imports (modules):
1. default export: import person from './person.js'

2. named exports:
    2.1 {smth as Smth} from './utility.js'

    2.2 import * as bundled from './utility.js'


classes: blueprint for objects

class Person extends Humen{
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = 'max';
    }
    PrintMyName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

const person = New Person();
person.PrintMyName();

// if you want to exend a class -> call super! so the super-class is called


spread operator: used to split up array elements OR object properties
    cost newArray = [...oldArray, 1, 2];
    const newObject = { ...oldObject, newProps: 5 }


rest operator: used to merge a list of function argumets into an newArray
    function sortArgs(...args) {
        return args.sort();
    }


destruturing: easy extract array elements or object properties and store them into variables.

    array destructuring:
        [a, b] = ['Hello', 'felix']
        console.log(a); // Hello





Components
----------------


1. Class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- accsss to state (and mutation)
- livecycle hooks (only here!) [NOT to confuse with 'React Hooks' !]
- extend Components
- this.state.XQ & this.props.XQ


class Cmp extends Component {
 render () {
    return <div>some JSX</div>
    }
 }


 2. Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components)
-------------------------
- default case
- access to state but not mutation 'useState()'
- NO livecycle-hooks
- accesss to props via props with 'props.YQ'

const cmp = () => {
    return <div>some JSX</div>
}



Only class-based components can define and use 'state' !
You can of course pass the state down to functional components,
but these then can't directly edit it. (cause they are dumb as shit)



Component Lifecycles (%)
----------------------------


- constructor()
    - call super(props)
    - setup State here


- getDerivedStateFromProps()
    -use for just update state

- render()
    - prepare & structure your jsx code

- componentDidMount()
    - cause side-effects
    - get feed here
    - DONT setState here (trigger re-render)

- getSnapshotsBeforeUpdate()


React hooks!
-------------

- useState can be initialised with default values like an array, a boolian or an object.
(compared to classicle state: always an object!)
