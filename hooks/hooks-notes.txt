react hooks
------------

repetion:
functional components ('dumb'):
-------------------------------
- only props in -> jsx out
- presentational
- focus on one purpose

--> here HOOKS comes into play!

classbased components
----------------------
- use state and props
- buisnes logic
- organises other components
- lifecycle hooks
